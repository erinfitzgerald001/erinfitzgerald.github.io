<h1><u>Some Basic Facts About Me:</u></h1>

	</ul>

<h1><u>In Detail:</u></h1>
<p>I currently attend a STEM academy and I am in the 11th grade. I don't really have a lot of friends, but the few I do have are really important to me (shoutout to Antoinette Angone, Milk Man-Senpai, and Daddy-Sama). I especially enjoy spending time with my horse, because said friends are generally pretty horrible. :) </p>

<h1><u>Opinions:</u></h1>
<h2>Hairless Cats and Why They Are Awful</h2>
<p>First of all, how AREN'T they awful? Having allergies is no excuse for a walking sack of flesh to exist. Hairless cats are destroying the cat community, and you'd have to be a weirdo to disagree. They look like what a regular cat would look lke turned inside out, or a really sad turkey dinner. Also, they are just really creepy. They are the Aaron Burr of the cat world, and everyone knows that Aaron Burr is terrible. You also have to take way more care of them than you would a regular cat because of the oils in their skin. They get colder more easily, and that's just extra money for heating when you could just have a cute, NORMAL LOOKING CAT and not have any problems.</p>
