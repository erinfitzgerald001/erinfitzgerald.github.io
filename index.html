<h1><u>In Detail:</u></h1>
<p>I currently attend a public high school in the 10th grade. I am in all honors classes, with the exception of my electives, as those are either not offered as honors other than my AP Psychology class. I don't really have a lot of friends, but the few I do have are really important to me. I especially enjoy spending time with Blake and my horse. I am hoping to get a job at Buck Creek, a place that allows special-needs children to be able to meet horses! :) </p>
<br />
<p>I am a pretty decent rider, in my opinion, and my horse is trained in the western pleasure discipline. He is seven years old, and he is a registered Quarter Horse and a resigtered Paint. He is pretty much my best friend, even when he's a butthead. < 3 I try to ride him every day, but sometimes, due to weather, I can't. -Sigh- I live for that jog~</p>

<p>My wonderful boyfriend, Blake, is the one who got me back into HTML and into programming. He also ascended me from my life of peasentry as a console player! So thank him for that plz. He is really supportive of me reteaching myself HTML and me programming. He is also super supportive of my riding, which makes me really happy because in all honesty, it bores a lot of people.</p>
<p><center>Here he is, in all of his lizard-penguin-person glory, chasing me xD</center></p>
